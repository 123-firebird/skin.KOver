# KOver [A Customizable KODI skin]

KOver (for KODI Overlay) offers a different approach of KODI skins. Not just purely designed, it also offers to the user the possibility to **customize it and make thousands of configurations**.
Born to be a PVR oriented skin with a half screen approach, the way the layout was coded evolved in time to allow to dynamically **change positions, sizes, colors and much more to your needs**.
However, because spending time into making it to look how you want is not the taste of everyone, **KOver can also build itself** with some presets.

## First start

When installing KOver and launching it for the first time, it will write some settings as minimum requirements for the skin to display correctly. Straight after the first start, only one viewtype per section will be available. You have then 2 options :

* Use the [autobuild](https://github.com/Jayz2K/skin.KOver#auto-build) feature to populate viewtypes
* Use the Designer to build your own viewtypes

## Auto Build

As said, the auto build feature is made for you to not spend time making all your viewtypes. It's also a good way to see what is possible to do with KOver before you start using the Designer. You will be able to modify the built viewtype after applying the auto build.

`SETTINGS > SKIN SETTINGS > AUTOBUILD`

### Auto Build : viewtypes

You can populate KOver with 5 different viewtype : 2 for a PVR use and 3 for a fullscreen use.

| Name | Description |
| ------ |  ----------- |
| **PVR : Horizontal** | Provides a set of viewtypes half screen in horizontal mode. |
| **PVR : Vertical** | Provides a set of viewtypes half screen in vertical mode. |
| **Fullscreen : Classic** | Provides a set of viewtypes full screen. Almost all the screen space is used. |
| **Fullscreen : Two-thirds** | Provides a set of viewtypes full screen. 2/3 of the screen is used, gives a more confortable view. |
| **Fullscreen : Hybrid** | Provides a set of viewtypes full screen. Combine some viewtype of the 2 above presets. |

### Auto Build : colors

You can apply 4 built-in color schemes.

| Name | Description |

| **Default light** | Apply a light/colorful color scheme. A good one for computer screens. |
