# KOver [A Customizable KODI sskin]

KOver (for KODI Overlay) offers a different approach of KODI skins. Not just purely designed, it also offers to the user the possibility to `customize it and make thousands of configurations`.
Born to be a PVR oriented skin with a half screen approach, the way the layout was coded evolved in time to allow to dynamically `change positions, sizes, colors and much more to your needs`.
However, because spending time into making it to look how you want is not the taste of everyone, `KOver can also build itself` with some presets.

## First start

When installing KOver and launching it for the first time, it will write some settings as minimum requirements for the skin to display correctly. Straight after the first start, only one viewtype per section will be available. You have then 2 options :

* Use the autobuild feature to populate viewtypes
* Use the Designer to build your own viewtypes
